# Synthetic Experiments

This folder contains the code to reproduce the synthetic  experiments on the toy problem of minimizing a quadratic loss function with respect to the parameters of  a tractable 5-subset  distribution (top-5).
The code is written in pytorch.  

To reproduce the results and produce the paper's plots, simply 
run the file `main.py`.
